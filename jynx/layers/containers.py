    `Recurrent` behaves similarly to `Sequential` but is specifically
    tailored for layers that can maintain a hidden state, making it
    suitable for recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. It allows
    for a mix of both recurrent and non-recurrent layers. Recurrent layers
    should conform to the `RecurrentModule` Protocol, accepting a state
    argument and returning a tuple of their output and updated state. They
    should also define an `initial_state` property. Non-recurrent layers
    should conform to the `Module` protocol.

    When iterating through the layers, `Recurrent` passes the output of
    the previous layer as the input to the next. For recurrent layers,
    it also manages the passing and updating of their states. The final
    output is the output of the last layer, and the method returns a
    list of updated states for all recurrent layers.

    Example:
        ```python
        rnn = Recurrent([
            rnn_cell(10, 256, key=k1),      # Recurrent layer
            Fn(jax.nn.relu),                # Non-recurrent layer
            lstm_cell(256, 256, key=k2),    # Recurrent layer
            Fn(jax.nn.sigmoid),             # Non-recurrent layer

        y1, state = rnn(x1, state)  # Process input x1, update states
        ```

        In this example, `rnn` is a `Recurrent` container with a mix of
        recurrent (e.g., `rnn_cell`, `lstm_cell`) and non-recurrent layers
        (e.g., `Fn(jax.nn.relu)`, `linear`). The `initial_state` provides
        initial states for the recurrent layers, while `None` is used for
        non-recurrent layers. The `rnn` object processes an input `x1`,
        updating the states of the recurrent layers and returning the final
        output `y1` and the updated states.

    """Constructs a densely connected container from a list of layers
    and functions.

    This function facilitates the creation of dense blocks where the
    output from each layer is concatenated with the outputs of all
    previous layers. It automatically wraps raw functions in an Fn object.

    Args:
        *layers: A list of layers or functions to be densely
            connected. Includes Module instances, raw functions,
            or any callable that conforms to the Module protocol.

    Returns:
        DenselyConnected: A DenselyConnected container with the given layers.

    Example:
        ```python
        net = densely_connected(
            conv(in_channels=16, out_channels=16, kernel_shape=(3, 3), padding="SAME", key=k1),
            jax.nn.relu,
            conv(in_channels=64, out_channels=32, kernel_shape=(3, 3), padding="SAME", key=k2),
        )
        ```

    """
    return DenselyConnected(map(wrap_if_function, layers))
