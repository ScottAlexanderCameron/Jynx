class PyTree:
    """A base class for network layers, making them compatible with JAX pytree operations.

    `PyTree` is designed to be subclassed by network layer classes,
    automatically converting them into dataclasses and registering them
    as pytree types with JAX. This registration enables instances of
    these classes to be seamlessly used with JAX functions like `jit`,
    `grad`, and `vmap`, allowing JAX to process their attributes as if
    they were native JAX types.

    The class provides methods for flattening and unflattening instances,
    compatible with JAX's expectations for pytree nodes. This allows
    custom data structures to be integrated into JAX workflows, supporting
    automatic differentiation and JIT compilation of functions that
    operate on complex data structures.

    Example:
        ```python
        class MyLayer(PyTree):
            weights: jax.Array
            biases: jax.Array

        # Now `MyLayer` instances can be used with JAX functions
        layer = MyLayer(weights=jnp.ones((10, 10)), biases=jnp.zeros(10))
        grad_fn = jax.grad(some_loss_function)
        gradients = grad_fn(layer)
        ```

    Note:
        Fields can be marked as static using the `static` function,
        indicating that they should not be considered as part of the
        tree structure for the purposes of JAX transformations.

    Attributes:
        Any attribute defined in subclasses will be automatically handled
        as part of the dataclass and, unless marked as static, will be
        considered dynamic attributes for JAX processing.
